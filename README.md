A simple "slider"/carousel. Features:
- Uses native horizontal scrollbars so as to not need to build all kinds of functionality to support mobile swipe/drag events.
- Doens't need to be re-initialized if content changes.
- Doesn't need to be re-initialized if window width changes.
- No dependencies, FWIW.
